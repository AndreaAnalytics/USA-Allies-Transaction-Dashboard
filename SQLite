-- Imported into SQLite

CREATE TABLE "USA" ('Country' TEXT,

'Reported_by_Authority' TEXT,
'Source_of_Money' TEXT,
'Money_Laundering_Risk_Score' INTEGER,

'Tax_Haven_Country' TEXT);

-- Aggregate Functions
-- Total Transactions Value by Country

SELECT country, SUM(amount) AS total_transactions
FROM USA
GROUP BY country;

-- Top 3 Countries Transferring Money to Tax Havens 

SELECT country, SUM(amount) AS sum_amount
FROM USA
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY sum_amount DESC
LIMIT 3;

-- Transactions Types with High Money Laundering Risk

FROM USA
WHERE money_laundering_risk_score >= 6 
GROUP BY transaction_type;

-- Most Frequent Transaction Types

SELECT transaction_type, COUNT(transaction_type) AS laundering_count, SUM(amount) AS total_transactions
FROM USA
GROUP BY transaction_type
